    # 'ubuntu-latest' is the standard, reliable choice.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # A job is a sequence of individual steps.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository's code.
      # 'uses' tells the job to run a pre-built, reusable action.
      # 'actions/checkout@v4' is the official action for downloading your code.
      - name: Checkout repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Run a simple echo command.
      # 'run' tells the job to execute a shell command.
      - name: Print a message
        run: echo "Hello, World! The CI workflow was triggered successfully"
